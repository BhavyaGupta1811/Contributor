## Introduction

We've noticed a rise in the number of cases where contributors gain high points for submissions that are not actual contributions.

Every contributor should remember one thing: Labels on PRs are a must have `gssoc`, `level1` or `level2` or `level3`.
- `level1`: 10 points
- `level2`: 25 points
- `level3`: 45 points

If you reach the top of the leaderboard with small code snippets, repeated copy-paste PRs, or spam PRs, you will be temporarily banned until we perform manual checks on suspicious contributions and reduce score on leaderboard.

---

## Important Points for Contributors

- **Meaningful Contributions**: Build your GitHub profile with meaningful badges and PRs.
- **Manual Verification**: Our team will verify most of your PR, espescially people on the top of leaderboard.
- **Avoid Spam**: Do not submit spam PRs or address similar issues repeatedly.
- **GitHub Profile**: If all of your contributions are meaningful to the projects, we have the potential to increase perks and opportunities including from the existing project admins. 

---

## Meaningful Contribution Guidelines

- Beginners can contribute to README files, workflows, or documentation.
- PRs for README, workflow, or documentation will be evaluated and potentially upgraded based on completeness.
- Do not create multiple document change issues. Inform the contributor who worked on the documentation for future updates.
- Follow a first-come, first-served approach for issues.
- Participate in only one role: PA, Mentor, or Contributor.
- Inactive projects for more than 2 weeks will be removed.

---

## Instructions for Mentors and Project Admins (PAs)

- **Fair Issue Assignment**: Follow a first-come, first-served approach.
- **Avoid Partiality**: Ensure fair assignment of issues, dont let PR without raising issues.
- **Single Role Participation**: PAs and Mentors should not contribute to the same projects to avoid conflict of interest.
- **Inactive Projects**: Projects inactive for more than 2 weeks will be removed.

---

## How to Detect Spam and Fake Contributions

- **Minimal Changes**: PRs with minimal changes that are not impactful and getting level 2 and level 3.
- **Multiple Roles**: Contributors acting as PAs or Mentors.
- **Instant PR Acceptance**: PRs accepted instantly without proper review.

### Report Suspicious Activity

- **Raise Discussion for it with PR links**: https://github.com/GSSoC24/Contributor/discussions/categories/q-a

---

### Non-Considerable PRs

- Multiple documentation or workflow issues.
- Exploiting personal connections with PAs or Mentors.
- Repeated documentation or workflow contributions beyond 200 points.
- Code snippets or template-related PRs.

## HOW TO DETECT SPAMS AND FAKE CONTRIBUTIONS -

## An example of this can be - üî¢

1. Gaining high rep points for submission such as changing -> README.MD to README.md and getting levels for it.

3. Contributing to the same project but each PR is having very minimal changes. This could either be changing a line of code (without actually being Impactful) or changes that are not necessary in the first place. This doesn't have to be strictly in any one project or code, line except for a typo.

5. Contributors are being PA as well for some projects. This is where contributors ask PA to give high levels for very basic changes which is not actually right. 

--- 

### How to detect them - üíØ

1. If you find anyone pushing PR with changing a single change which are not necessary in a same project and gaining high reps for it. Kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
2. If any PA is also accepting PR from any contributor which shouldn't be accepted in the first place or giving high reps or assigning labels that should not be given, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
3. Anyone who suspects someone who is contributing at a particular time and his/her PR instantly is getting accepted regardless of being an actual contribution, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
4. If anyone who suspects that PA is the contributor itself or vice versa, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
5. Even if you find anyone suspicious kindly let us know @sanjay-kv

---

### Why are we doing this? - üëç

This is being done keeping everyone in mind for being hardworking enough to contribute something meaningful even if it's something small. We are doing this to make this event fair and memorable for all.

### Spam PRs or PRs Won't consider:
1. If you create multiple Issues on documentation or workflow. Your PRs won't be considered.
2. If you know the PA or mentor. If you take advantage of it to make more PRs. Your PRs won't be considered.
3. If you completely depend on documentation or workflow or GitHub bots, Only the first 200 points will be considered. Focus on a variety of contributions.
4. If you create a code snippet PR for example a PR for issue template, a PR for PR temple, etc. Your PRs won't be considered. 
5. Contributors, you are free to create any number of PRs in any repos excluding few repo listed below. Sticking to a particular repo will give you a strong command of the project and the tech stack. However, if we see you spamming PRs or issues, severe action will be taken against you.

Note: We request everyone to follow the above guidelines. We aim to make open source accessible to everyone, including beginners. If you all follow the instructions, it will help us bring more perks to you. Otherwise, it will push us to verify your PRs

## Final Notes

We request everyone to follow the above guidelines. Our aim is to make open source accessible to everyone, including beginners. Genuine contributions will help you build healthy relationships and secure good jobs. Let's make this year‚Äôs GSSoC one with a high number of contributors, meaningful contributions, and exciting perks.

If you find someone violating these rules, please inform us.

Wishing you all a happy contribution!! üëç

Thanks & Regards,  
GSSoC Team

---------------------------- Detailed description below. üëáüèª




If you reach the top of the leaderboard with small code snippets, repeated copy paste PR or spam PRs, you will only be at the top temporarily as we do manual check on suspeciosu contributions. We do manual check on the leaderboard for most of the leaderboard contributions. This is because we promised to give Job Fair and other perks to genuine contributors which include web3 conf tickets as well. Additionally, we assured our partner companies that we would recommend good and skilled contributors. <br>

Therefore, we remove all spam and unnecessary PRs. During this process, our team will verify all your PRs. Do not repeatedly address similar issues. You need to build your GitHub profile with meaningful badges and PRs. In the future, if you apply to any company, they will primarily check your GitHub profile. If they see your badges, they will get a good impression of you and ideally they will check your merged PRs. They will only consider you if they are meaningful. If you have spam PRs, they won't consider you.

If all of your contributions are  meaningful to the projects, we have the potential to increase perks and opportunities including from the existing project admins. We are adding a few rules to reduce spam PRs. We have defined meaningful PRs below. Please follow them.

Below Instructions are for everyone(mentors, project admins, contributors)

Note: Meaningful contribution means

1. If you are a beginner or if don't have any experience with README files, workflows, or documentation, you can contribute to those types of issues.
2. If you create a PR for a README, workflow, or document-related issue, it is your responsibility to make future PRs on the README or workflow for free, with no level or GSSoC label. Currently, we assign level 1 to these types of issues. If you contribute without a label, we will evaluate the changes and potentially upgrade your PR to level 2 or level 3 based on the completeness of the README, workflow, or document changes.
3. PAs or Mentors, please don't create multiple document change issues. Instead, inform the contributor who worked on the documentation if possible.
4. PAs or Mentors, please follow a first-come, first-served approach. We found that some repos assign issues with partiality. If an issue is created by someone, ask the creator, "Do you want to work on it or is it open to all?" If they want to work on it, assign it to them; if not, make it an open issue and assign it on a first-come, first-served basis.
5. Everyone, please ensure you can participate in only one role as a PA, Mentor, or Contributor. Not multiple roles. If we find someone with multiple roles, severe action will be taken because we have mentioned this point from the beginning of the program.

6. PAs or Mentors, if any repo is inactive for more than 2 weeks, we will remove that project.
7. Contributors, make sure that if you are a coder, you contribute to meaningful coding issues, spamming won't help in any way, and we have a strict team this time to check it this year. 
8. Contributors, before raising an issue, please check if it has already been raised. If it has not been raised, then create the issue.
9. All GitHub repo-related PRs won't be recreated. GitHub repo-related PRs include documentation, bots, workflows, templates, etc. If you are assigned one issue related to this point, then you have complete responsibility for that issue in the future. You need to create unlabelled PRs for those future updates. Opensource is not just about the leaderboard and points. 
10. Contributors, if your code change may affect the repo's functionality but the code is important, then update the README in your PR.
11. If you are working on migration code, create PRs and issues based on the difficulty of the complete migration work. Discuss with mentors or PAs and create the issue accordingly.
