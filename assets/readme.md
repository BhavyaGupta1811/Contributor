## Guidelines for Contribution.

### Hello contributors, we hope all are doing great,ü•á
 
 Yes, This Year is very special than all previous years, because we have more than 27k contributors not only from India we have some contributors from other countries, and the Highest PR request compared to all other GSSOC events. 
 
There have been quite a number of cases recently being noticed that few contributors are gaining very high points for their submission which is not quite an actual contribution.

 Every contributor should remember one thing. Labels on PR are must `gsooc`, `level1` or `level2` or `level3` where
 * Level1 = 10 points
 * Level2 = 25 points
 * Level 3= 45 points.

If you reach the top of the leaderboard with small code snippets, repeated copy paste PR or spam PRs, you will only be at the top temporarily as we do manual check on suspeciosu contributions. We do manual check on the leaderboard for most of the leaderboard contributions. This is because we promised to give Job Fair and other perks to genuine contributors which include web3 conf tickets as well. Additionally, we assured our partner companies that we would recommend good and skilled contributors. <br>

Therefore, we remove all spam and unnecessary PRs. During this process, our team will verify all your PRs. Do not repeatedly address similar issues. You need to build your GitHub profile with meaningful badges and PRs. In the future, if you apply to any company, they will primarily check your GitHub profile. If they see your badges, they will get a good impression of you and ideally they will check your merged PRs. They will only consider you if they are meaningful. If you have spam PRs, they won't consider you.

If all of your contributions are  meaningful to the projects, we have the potential to increase perks and opportunities including from the existing project admins. We are adding a few rules to reduce spam PRs. We have defined meaningful PRs below. Please follow them.

Below Instructions are for everyone(mentors, project admins, contributors)

Note: Meaningful contribution means

1. If you are a beginner or if don't have any experience with README files, workflows, or documentation, you can contribute to those types of issues.
2. If you create a PR for a README, workflow, or document-related issue, it is your responsibility to make future PRs on the README or workflow for free, with no level or GSSoC label. Currently, we assign level 1 to these types of issues. If you contribute without a label, we will evaluate the changes and potentially upgrade your PR to level 2 or level 3 based on the completeness of the README, workflow, or document changes.
3. PAs or Mentors, please don't create multiple document change issues. Instead, inform the contributor who worked on the documentation if possible.
4. PAs or Mentors, please follow a first-come, first-served approach. We found that some repos assign issues with partiality. If an issue is created by someone, ask the creator, "Do you want to work on it or is it open to all?" If they want to work on it, assign it to them; if not, make it an open issue and assign it on a first-come, first-served basis.
5. Everyone, please ensure you can participate in only one role as a PA, Mentor, or Contributor. Not multiple roles. If we find someone with multiple roles, severe action will be taken because we have mentioned this point from the beginning of the program.

6. PAs or Mentors, if any repo is inactive for more than 2 weeks, we will remove that project.
7. Contributors, make sure that if you are a coder, you contribute to meaningful coding issues, spamming won't help in any way, and we have a strict team this time to check it this year. 
8. Contributors, before raising an issue, please check if it has already been raised. If it has not been raised, then create the issue.
9. All GitHub repo-related PRs won't be recreated. GitHub repo-related PRs include documentation, bots, workflows, templates, etc. If you are assigned one issue related to this point, then you have complete responsibility for that issue in the future. You need to create unlabelled PRs for those future updates. Opensource is not just about the leaderboard and points. 
10. Contributors, if your code change may affect the repo's functionality but the code is important, then update the README in your PR.
11. If you are working on migration code, create PRs and issues based on the difficulty of the complete migration work. Discuss with mentors or PAs and create the issue accordingly.

### Spam PRs or PRs Won't consider:
1. If you create multiple Issues on documentation or workflow. Your PRs won't be considered.
2. If you know the PA or mentor. If you take advantage of it to make more PRs. Your PRs won't be considered.
3. If you completely depend on documentation or workflow or GitHub bots, Only the first 200 points will be considered. Focus on a variety of contributions.
4. If you create a code snippet PR for example a PR for issue template, a PR for PR temple, etc. Your PRs won't be considered. 
5. Contributors, you are free to create any number of PRs in any repos excluding few repo listed below. Sticking to a particular repo will give you a strong command of the project and the tech stack. However, if we see you spamming PRs or issues, severe action will be taken against you.

Note: We request everyone to follow the above guidelines. We aim to make open source accessible to everyone, including beginners. If you all follow the instructions, it will help us bring more perks to you. Otherwise, it will push us to verify your PRs instead of bringing new opportunities and perks. Please support us and understand the mission of GSSoC. We aim to make our country technically ahead of others and bring out your full potential. Genuine contributions will help you build healthy relationships and secure good jobs. Please help fellow contributors as well. It‚Äôs your responsibility to make meaningful contributions, and it‚Äôs our responsibility to bring more perks to you. We are planning new opportunities for those who contribute meaningfully instead of spamming PRs or not contributing effectively. Let‚Äôs make this year‚Äôs GSSoC one with a high number of contributors, meaningful contributions, and exciting perks.

If anyone finds someone violating these rules, please inform us.
1.  Issue get assigned and once the users do PR, admin close the PR without further information. https://github.com/urstrulynishkarsh/ReactChat/issues/125


## HOW TO DETECT SPAMS AND FAKE CONTRIBUTIONS -

## An example of this can be - üî¢

1. Gaining high rep points for submission such as changing -> README.MD to README.md => [https://github.com/jfmartinz/ResourceHub/pull/314]
2. Contributing to a same project but each PR is having very minimal changes. This could either be changing a line of code (without actually being Impactful) or changes which are not being necessary in the first place. This doesn't have to be strictly in any one project or code, line expect for a typo. => [https://github.com/Suchitra-Sahoo/AgriLearnNetwork/pull/254]
3. Contributors are being PA as well for some projects. This is where, contributors ask PA to give high levels for very basic changes which is not actually right. => [https://github.com/HimanshuNarware/Devlabs/pull/605]

## How to detect them - üíØ

1. If you find anyone pushing PR with changing a single change which are not necessary in a same project and gaining high reps for it. Kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
2. If any PA is also accepting PR from any contributor which shouldn't be accepted in the first place or giving high reps or assigning labels which should not be given, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
3. Anyone who suspects someone who is contributing at a particular time and his/her PR instantly is getting accepted regardless of being an actual contribution, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
4. If anyone who suspects where PA is the contributor itself or vice versa, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
5. Even if you find anyone suspicious kindly let us know @sanjay-kv

## Why are we doing this? - üëç

This is being done keeping everyone in mind for being hardworking enough to contribute something meaningful even if it's something small. We are doing this to make this event fair and memorable for all.
