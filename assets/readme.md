## Guidelines

Project Related Issues.

1.  Issue get assigned and once the users do PR, admin close the PR without further information. https://github.com/urstrulynishkarsh/ReactChat/issues/125
2.  I hope all PA are there on Discord.
3.  Whatever PA and mentors there are, have they been added to their separate project channel or not,
4.  If not, then keep your queries in mentors general and PA general.
5.  All mentors should have at least one active project, even if there are 2 then it is fine.
6.  Those who do not have even a single active project will have to get themselves assigned to a new project.
7.  All the other mentors should be active, if they are not then they will be removed.
8.  Come online and visit repo two times a day.
9.  If we open a project channel for the contributors they will make queries only on that particular¬†channel.
10. Good review approach, do everything at one go rather than demand over PR. Use Discussion boards.

## HOW TO DETECT SPAMS AND FAKE CONTRIBUTERS -

## Summary - ü•á

There has been quite a number of cases recently being noticed that few contributors are gaining very high points for their submission which is not quite an actual contribution.

## An example of this can be - üî¢

1. Gaining high rep points for submission such as changing -> README.MD to README.md
2. Contributing to a same project but each PR is having very minimal changes. This could either be changing a line of code (without actually being Impactful) or changes which are not being necessary in the first place. This doesn't have to be strictly in any one project or code, line expect for a typo.
3. Contributors are being PA as well for some projects. This is where, contributors ask PA to give high levels for very basic changes which is not actually right.

## How to detect them - üíØ

1. If you find anyone pushing PR with changing a single change which are not necessary in a same project and gaining high reps for it. Kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
2. If any PA is also accepting PR from any contributor which shouldn't be accepted in the first place or giving high reps or assigning labels which should not be given, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
3. Anyone who suspects someone who is contributing at a particular time and his/her PR instantly is getting accepted regardless of being an actual contribution, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
4. If anyone who suspects where PA is the contributor itself or vice versa, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
5. Even if you find anyone suspicious kindly let us know @sanjay-kv

## Why are we doing this? - üëç

This is being done keeping everyone in mind for being hardworking enough to contribute something meaningful even if it's something small. We are doing this to make this event fair and memorable for all.

## Note -
## You have to look out for these in the TOP 25 list of contributors because that is where high chances are there for tampering.

## Wishing you all a happy contribution!! üëç

## Thanks & Regards
