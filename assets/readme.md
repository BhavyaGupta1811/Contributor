## Guideliness 

Project Related Issues.

1. Issue get assigned and once the users do PR, admin close the PR without further information. https://github.com/urstrulynishkarsh/ReactChat/issues/125
2.  I hope all PA are there on Discord.
3.  Whatever PA and mentors there are, have they been added to their separate project channel or not,
4.  If not, hen keep your queries in mentors general and PA general.
5.  All mentors should have at least one active project, even if there are 2 then it is fine.
6. Those who do not have even a single active project will have to get themselves assigned to a new project.
7.  All the other mentors should be active, if they are not then they will be removed.
8.  Come online and visit repo two times a day.
9.  If we open a project channel for the contributors they will make queries only on that particularÂ channel.
