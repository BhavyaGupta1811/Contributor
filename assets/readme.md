## Guideliness 

Project Related Issues.

1. Issue get assigned and once the users do PR, admin close the PR without further information. https://github.com/urstrulynishkarsh/ReactChat/issues/125
2.  Are you joined the server, if not then please join now.
3.  Whatever PA and mentors there are, have they been added to their separate project channel or not, if not, then keep your queries in mentors general and PA general.
4.  All mentors should have at least one active project, even if there are 2 then it is fine but those who do not have even a single active project will have to get themselves assigned to a new project.
5.  All the other mentors should be active, if they are not then they are removed, it's not like  to stay online the whole day, but at least come online two times a day.
6.  Because if we open a project channel for the contributors they will make queries only on that particularÂ channel.
